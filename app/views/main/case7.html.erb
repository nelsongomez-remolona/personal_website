He along with his co-founders saw the parallels between their idea of 'family' in the team to the one held by people in Greek life. With that, he saw how countless amounts of students want to be part of something bigger themselves which henced inspired him to start a company that heavily dedicates itself to helping people get there. In this particular context, through helping Greek life. The company eventually partnered with Chapman's User Experience Society to provide the technical expertise for the project." %>

Moreover, Affiliated hopes to makes the asset management for the people running these organizations variably easier knowing that there are a lot and that it could be too complex to process efficiently for the average college student." %>

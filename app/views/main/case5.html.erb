	<p class="typical">An offshoot of the ECO Auto Solutions brand, Heck Yea! Team is a brand that caters to high-end car owners aged thirty year old and up. With an overall negative perception pervading across the industry, the owners of ECO Auto Solutions seeks to get above that and revolutionize the auto repair industry by offering transparent and quality service through their new brand Heck Yea! Team. With that said, they sought out to have their brand kickstarted with a new website quick and fast. Hence, I opted to skip out of intensive research at the beginning and right into prototyping.

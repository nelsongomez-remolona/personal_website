With that, he saw how countless amounts of students want to be part of something bigger themselves which henced inspired him to start a company that heavily dedicates itself to helping people get there. In this particular context, through helping Greek life. The company eventually partnered with Chapman's User Experience Society to provide the technical expertise for the project." %>
